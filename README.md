# Code Factory

A local, agent-independent coding loop factory. React + TypeScript, shadcn/ui, Tailwind, and Vite supply the UI; a Node CLI hosts it and accesses project files. The npm package will include both parts.

## Development

Requires Node >=22.12 and pnpm 11.8.0.

```sh
pnpm install
pnpm dev
```

Open the URL printed by Vite (normally http://127.0.0.1:4311). Development runs the UI and API together in one application process, with a dynamically selected API port and `/api` proxy. Vite selects another port if 4311 is occupied. UI hot reload is enabled; runtime changes restart development through tsx watch. `Ctrl+C` shuts down both HTTP servers.

```sh
pnpm check         # format, lint, strict types, tests, production build
pnpm format       # format source
pnpm build
pnpm test:package # production npm installation and packaged CLI/UI smoke test
node dist/node/cli.js --help
node dist/node/cli.js doctor
node dist/node/cli.js init /path/to/project
node dist/node/cli.js start --project /path/to/project
```

The built package serves its bundled UI on http://127.0.0.1:4310. Use `--port 0` to select an available port automatically. Initialization exclusively creates `.code-factory/project.json`; it does not overwrite existing configuration or agent folders. No agent, model, or loop is preselected. `doctor` locates executable candidates without launching them; detection does not establish their identity, authentication, or capabilities.

## Current scope

This is the layout-independent foundation. Versioned loop drafts and published definitions can be stored under `.code-factory/loops`; runs and append-only evidence histories can be stored under `.code-factory/runs`. Portable schemas validate dependencies, groups, joins, decisions, bounded repeats, snapshots, attempts, events, guidance, receipts, outputs, provenance and freshness. A deterministic mock implements the step event contract, with unsupported steering/recovery declared explicitly. A Codex app-server adapter implements connection inspection and isolated step turns behind the same contract. The local HTTP API exposes health, project configuration, candidate discovery, and an explicit Codex verification handoff. Project defaults persist in `.code-factory/project.json`; verified connections are held only for the current runtime session. Custom agents can use an explicitly selected executable with the verified Codex app-server protocol. Cursor, Kiro, and Claude Code remain discovery-only candidates until their adapters are implemented.

Task intake now saves pending runs from a published loop and a verified agent binding. It snapshots a description, an optional retrieved Linear ticket, and an isolated Git baseline. The scheduler and real file-changing execution are still separate work; creating a run does not start an agent. Each run gets a private clone under `.code-factory/workspaces`, with tracked edits, staged changes, deletions, and untracked files copied into it. The original working tree is not modified. Concurrent runs use separate clones.

Optional Linear retrieval is configured by supplying `CODE_FACTORY_LINEAR_API_KEY` in the runtime process environment. The key is never written to the project or returned by the API. Without it, description-only intake remains available.

## Packaging

```sh
pnpm pack
```

The tarball includes the CLI, compiled portable contracts, built UI, and architecture docs. It is suitable for installation from a local tarball. The package is marked private until its public name and publishing scope are decided. Development uses pnpm; consumers will be able to install the release through npm.
